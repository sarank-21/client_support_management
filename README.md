```
###### The app will launch in your browser at :👉 http://localhost:8501/

## 🔑 Sample Users
username	password	Role

support_admin	support123	Support

client_user	client123	Client

## 📊 Dataset
* The project comes with a sample dataset (sample_queries_250.csv) containing 1000 client queries generated for testing purposes.

📂 Dataset Columns:

`email`,`mobile`,`query_heading`,`query_description`

`query_created_time`,`status`,`query_closed_time`

## 🔄 How It Works
1. User Authentication → New user can Register and Login based on role.
